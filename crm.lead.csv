 He asked for a price point closer to $.90. Joe told him no way in hell. Joe informed him the difference between China and the United States. Joe gave him a price point closer to $1.22. The other price point that they are interested in is if we switch our current the G/PG supplier with dowel chemical and if they can save and have a price closer to a dollar 05.

 We can see what we can do. This is a hot white labeling account. They are looking to move forward as soon as possible. They seem very price orientated. However, we have them from the balls, because we position ourselves like bawlers. We are the source. M*therf*ckers need us.

They buy the 15ml of tasteless e-liquid for $4.99, and the bottle of flavoring for $0.99.  Sounds kind of interesting.

Mohammed is interested in JJuice but he is a CHEAP CHEAP buyer.  He is the co-owner of the shop.  THey currently have Lush, who hasn't refilled their order in 2+ months.  He thinks that they have gone out of business.
Deals I offered him if he bought at the show, which he didn't:
JB @ $50
Drip @ $8
10mls @ $2.25.
Those prices were if he picked up all three packages, or at least 2.
I called this guy a couple times while I was still in Florida.  He is such a cheap skate that I consistently had him as my plan b.  I was never able to make it to his shop...it was about a 90 minute drive from where I was staying as well.  Worth calling.

Priceing:
Price per gallon: $248.50
1 gallon equals 3,785ml
Price per ml equals $0.0656 

This means that your cost selling a 30ml bottle of e-liquid would be $1.96.  If you sell the 30ml bottle for 18.99 you will profit $17.03 per bottle you sell.  Per gallon you can expect to profit $2148.61.

He wants us to do 2 PRIVATE LABEL DEALS for him:
-He wants us to situate the invoices for him so that he only pays the exorbitant tax rate on the nicotine.

PRIVATE LABEL DEAL for 50/50 line (10-20 flavors)(15ml and 30ml)
-He wants us to do the graphic design work, but still wants us to just send him gallons for him to fill himself.
-He does however want us to put the labels on the empty bottles.
-So, we would send him buckets of eliquid, empty labeled bottles, and stacks of shrink sleeves.
-We send only buckets of 24mg (18mg) and 0mg.  He himself, will mix to create the other nicotine levels.

PRIVATE LABEL DEAL FOR DRIP LINE 70/30 (6ish flavors)
-Similar to above, the only difference is here we will send him buckets of eliquid in 0mg, 3mg, 6mg, 9mg, and 12mg.  
-So, he will bottle himself, but he will NOT mix the buckets together to create other nicotine levels.
-We do the graphic design work.
-We still send him empty labeled bottls and stacks of tamper proof sleeves.

VERIFY WITH HIM IF HE WANTS US TO LABEL THE EMPTY BOTTLES OR IF HE WOULD RATHER US SEND HIM EMPTY BOTTLES AND ROLLS OF LABELS

11-11-15  Last week Ayman came up to me at our booth.  I was right in the middle of a sale, when he quickly intertupted me to give me his card, and to tell me that he is now ready.  After gettting back from the show, I called him multiple times on monday and tuesday, and again wednesday morning.  It just rings and rings, the one time an employee picked up, Ayman was gone.  So, today I proceeded to send Ayman an email, we'll see if it works.
11-13-15 I called, and employee Taylor (girl) answered.  Ayman was not there but she said that most likely he would be this afternoon.  I had her leave a note message for Ayman in a place that he would see it, with my cell phone number on it.  I'll call back as well at 3pm MST. I called back at 3:30pm, Ayman was still not in.
12-10-15  I have tried calling probably about 5 times in the last month as I've been on the road.  I am yet to get in touch with Ayman.  I called again today and it rang and rang.
I dug deeper.  I went through my notes from SSE in Park City and I found another number that Ayman gave me.  It's not on his card, so I think it is his cell phone!  I called that number, again no answer.  So I sent a text.  Fingers crossed.
12-15 I called, no answer.
I continued calling a few more times.  Never got ahold of Ayman.
1-5-16 Low and Behold, Ayman answers his cell phone.  SUPER EXCITED TO TALK TO ME.  He was over seas and said that he got my message, and was sorry he didn't get back in touch.  Now that he is back state side, he is ready to move forward.  The goal is to have everything situated come Champs in Las Vegas next month.  Steps:
1.  Send Ayman email breaking down 2 lines, flavor options, price w/ finished unit vs. gallons. Apt. set.
2.  Call Ayman in one week, after he has had a chance to read email and meet with Moose on how to move forward. Apt. set.
3.  Go back and forth dialing in flavors, etc.
4.  At Champs, go to dinner with Ayman and Moose, and close the deal in person.","","952-226-2800","","","Lead","__export__.res_partner_title_10","0.0","__export__.res_users_5","","14101 Highway 13 South","","SSE 9/15-Savage & Prior Lake Tobacco","","Normal","0","","Savage","","0.0","",""

-He was very intrigued when he heard through the grapevine at the show that there were a couple other distributors that picked up our product.  I could tell when he told me, that his interest was peaked.

GAME PLAN: Reach out to and keep an open flow of communication between now and when I go to Portland.  In Portland impress him and give him yet another reason to work with us.
